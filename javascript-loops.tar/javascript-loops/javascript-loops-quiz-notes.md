## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Loops are essential to perform repeated tasks based on a stated condition.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The condition is what determines when a loop, typically ends. If the condition remains true, the loop will keep returning. Of course, you can use a break statement to terminate a loop.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Iteration is when code is executed for each element in a set.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition statement is evaluated before executing the statement.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It is evaluated only before the statement is ran for the first time
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression is tested each time the loop is repeated.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It is executed at the end of each loop
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  The break keyword
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increments one to its operand and returns value before or after the increment
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You can use the for in loop
